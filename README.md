This GIT Repository contains all the necessary Codes and Informations created within
my PhD_Thesis at both [Free University of Bolzano ](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/sciencetechnology/)
and [EURAC Research ](http://www.eurac.edu) from 11/2017 to 11/2020.

The Codes are divided in different parts:
* In Situ Plots for the computation of the insitu data
* Computation of the Phenocam Images
* Computation of Remote Sensing data, especially Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2
* Bringing together In-situ, PhenoCam and Remote Sensing Data


### Dependancies

Most of the presented scripts rely on my own Package Mfunction - hosted here on Github.
The Phenocam Pictures are highly dependent on the PhenoPix package and Phenomix integration
