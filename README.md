This repository contains parts of the codes necessary for my PhD thesis from 11/2016 to 11/2019 at both [EURAC Research](http://www.eurac.edu) ant the [Free University of Bolzano](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/sciencetechnology/)

The repo consists of codes for manipulating:

**In-situ Data**

  * Spectroradiometers, LAI, SWC probes
  * Tidy table generation in the form of OGC SOS standards

**Station Data**

  * Read Data acquired automatically from SRS (Spectral Reflectance Sensors) within the [MONALISA](http://monalisasos.eurac.edu/sos/) station network
  * For automated access to the MONALISA station network please checkout the [MonalisR](https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/earth_observation_public/MonalisR) Package

### Use

The codes provided within this repository are intended for my own PhD work and are therefore hardly compatible with other Datasets. However, if you come across a useful function don't hesitate to [contact me](mattia.ross@eurac.edu)

### Dependencies

Most of the presented scripts rely on my own [Package Mfunction](https://github.com/mattia6690/Mfunctions) and the Packages developed within the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
